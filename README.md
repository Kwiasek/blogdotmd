# **blog.md**

Blog application where you can view, add, modify and delete your posts. All posts are written in markdown language. I use [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) and [markedjs](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) to translate .md to html elements. State is managed by [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) library.
